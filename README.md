# Whitespace and Brainfuck
During the local hacker day in Deland, Florida (Stetson University) I made a [depressed bot](https://github.com/wsdt/DepressedBot) and during the time I trained him with Twitter data I thought: Why not learning a little bit Whitespace and Brainfuck. 

## Whitespace language
Simple Whitespace program (*.ws) which outputs a sentence (compile it so the it).

## Brainfuck language
Simple brainfuck program (*.bf) which prints ascii characters starting from '!' until inputted character value is zero.
